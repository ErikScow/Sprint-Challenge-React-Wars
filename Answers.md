3. Describe state.
State is something you can control on pretty much anything in a react app. Basically you can set up state for things like data or elements on a page. Then you can control what happens to that state under certain circumstances. It is useful when dealing with dynamic data or things like click events.
4. Describe props.
Props is a means of passing data between react components. Using props allows you to keep your code organized.
5. What are side effects, and how do you sync effects in a React component to state or prop changes?
Side effects, when using the useEffect property, are effects that you can trigger whenever the dom updates. You can sync them to certain changed using the dependencies array.
